# DSD.mael.im

Welcome !

This website lists a few tips you should know to get the most out of Logisim.

> [!CAUTION]
> The tips and tutorials were written before the reform, as the DSD course has since been redesigned. Although the tips may still be useful, they are by no means a replacement for the course.

## Tutorials

Tutorials can be found in the menu. It is advisable to start [at the beginning](tips/logisim/download-logisim) and read them from there.

Each tutorial uses a Logisim project to illustrate its subject. The projects and other documents used can be downloaded from the appendix at the bottom of the tutorial page.

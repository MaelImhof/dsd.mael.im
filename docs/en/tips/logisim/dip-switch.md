# The DIP-Switch

The previous tutorials dealt with simple 1-bit and multi-bit inputs :

These simple inputs are not the only ones available in Logisim. Others are available in the [additional components](general-logisim-ui#3-additional-components), such as the **DIP-Switch**, which this tutorial quickly focuses on.

> [!NOTE]
> The DIP-Switch is not necessarily vital in itself, but it is sometimes used in graded TPs, so this tutorial mentions it briefly.

## DIP-Switch functioning

The DIP-Switch is simple to understand. It is a type of input equivalent to several 1-bit inputs. Here's what it looks like :

![`An image of a DIP-switch should appear here`](/logisim/images/logisim-dip-switch-what-it-is-like.png)

Each switch corresponds to one bit. The number of switches can be changed in the [properties](general-logisim-ui#4-properties).

## Interacting with a DIP-Switch

To change the value of the inputs, simply use the [hand tool](general-logisim-ui#the-hand) by clicking on the switch to be changed.

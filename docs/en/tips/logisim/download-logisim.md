# Installing Logisim

Various software tools will be required during the semester in DSD, Logisim being the first and by far the easiest to install.

> [!TIP]
> Logisim is installed on the EPFL VMs. Using them could therefore be a solution. You will then need to use the [EPFL VPN](https://www.epfl.ch/campus/services/en/it-services/network-services/remote-intranet-access/vpn-clients-available/) and the client that [connects to their VMs](https://vdi.epfl.ch/).

## Installing Logisim on your own computer

If using the EPFL VMs is not convenient, you can install Logisim on your own machine.

The installation material can be found in [Logisim's GitHub releases](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases/tag/v3.8.0) (this is open-source software).

At the bottom of the linked page are the different installers, depending on the host OS :

![`An image of the list should appear here`](/images/logisim/logisim-installation-installers-list.png)

- **Windows** : One of the `.msi` files depending on your architecture
- **MacOS** : `.dmg`
- **Linux** : `.rpm` or `.deb` depending on your distribution

A `.jar` file is also available if Java is installed on the target machine.

> [!CAUTION]
> The link and image given above use `Logisim v3.8.0` as an example. It is important to check that this is the version currently in use for the DSD course, as it may have changed.

After launching the installer and following its instructions, Logisim should be installed.
